"Pelosi to step down from US House leadership, passing to a new generation","By Reuters  &nbspNovember 17, 2022 | 06:22 pm PT","Nancy Pelosi, the trailblazing Democrat who as the first woman U.S. House of Representatives speaker shepherded landmark legislation and led two impeachments, said on Thursday she will give up her leadership role a day after Republicans secured control of the chamber.","Nancy Pelosi, the trailblazing Democrat who as the first woman U.S. House of Representatives speaker shepherded landmark legislation and led two impeachments, said on Thursday she will give up her leadership role a day after Republicans secured control of the chamber.","Pelosi's allies quickly rallied around Representative Hakeem Jeffries as her likely successor as the top House Democrat while Republicans prepared to install a speaker from their party who is expected to impede President Joe Biden's legislative agenda. Her replacement will have to unite fractious House Democrats torn between centrists and an increasingly vocal left flank.
An 82-year-old California liberal, Pelosi made her announcement during a speech on the House floor - drawing applause from Democrats even as many Republicans decided not to attend. She said she will not retire from the House but continue to represent San Francisco as she has done for 35 years.
""For me, the hour's come for a new generation to lead the Democratic caucus that I so deeply respect. And I'm grateful that so many are ready and willing to shoulder this awesome responsibility,"" said Pelosi, who has served as the top House Democrat for two decades and speaker from 2007-2011 and again from 2019 until the present.
Pelosi played a central role in shepherding the legislative agenda of two Democratic presidents through Congress, even as she was vilified by many conservatives. She helped pass President Barack Obama's signature 2010 healthcare law as well as expansions of infrastructure and climate spending and gun regulations under Biden. She also presided as the House impeached Republican President Donald Trump in 2019 and 2021.
Biden in a statement called Pelosi ""the most consequential speaker of the House of Representatives in our history.""
House Democrats are set to vote on their leaders on Nov. 30. Jeffries, of New York, would be the first Black lawmaker to lead one of the major parties' caucuses in Congress. The No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer, endorsed Jeffries for the top leadership post and decided not to seek a leadership role in the next Congress.
Jeffries, 52, declined to comment on his plans, telling reporters: ""Today is a day to celebrate the speakership of Nancy Pelosi.""
Following last week's midterm elections, Republicans on Wednesday finally nailed down a slim majority in the House for the next Congress to be sworn in on Jan. 3 and offered initial support for Kevin McCarthy, who has had chilly relations with Pelosi, to serve as speaker. McCarthy did not attend Pelosi's speech.
Democrats retained control of the Senate. With a divided Congress, passage of even critical legislation like government funding could be tricky. Republicans said they plan to use their House majority to launch investigations into Biden's administration and family.
Pelosi, holding a post second in the line of succession to the presidency, delivered a sentimental speech calling the House chamber ""sacred ground"" and remembering visiting the Capitol for the first time as a child when her father was sworn in as a congressman.
She recounted working with three presidents - Republican George W. Bush as well as Obama and Biden. She did not mention Trump but she alluded to the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by his supporters.
""American democracy is majestic, but it is fragile. Many of us here have witnessed our fragility firsthand, tragically, in this chamber. And so democracy must be forever defended from forces that wish it harm,"" Pelosi said.
Pelosi also noted the increase in women and minority lawmakers since she joined the House in 1987. She was the highest-ranking and most powerful elected woman in U.S. history until Kamala Harris became vice president in January 2021. She also helped the party to stem its losses during the midterms, when Democrats lost fewer seats than expected in the House.
Aging leadership
Pelosi had been under pressure over the past few years from younger House Democrats to yield power. The party's aging leadership has raised questions about its future even as Americans are living longer. Biden himself turns 80 on Sunday.
Ahead of her announcement, Pelosi had said the Oct. 28 assault on her husband Paul by a politically motivated hammer-wielding intruder in their San Francisco home factored in her decision.
Democrats appeared to be lining up for an orderly transition that would see Jeffries as Democratic leader and Representatives Katherine Clark, 59, and Pete Aguilar, 43, filling out the top ranks of leadership.
""It's pretty much general agreement about who the next leaders will be. I know all of them, they'll do a good job,"" Representative Bennie Thompson told reporters.
The current No. 3 House Democrat, James Clyburn, 82, will likely stay on in an advisory role, several Democrats said.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/pelosi-to-step-down-from-us-house-leadership-passing-to-a-new-generation-4537497.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/pelosi-to-step-down-from-us-house-leadership-passing-to-a-new-generation-4537497.html#box_comment"")"
"China halts military, climate dialogue with US over Pelosi Taiwan trip","By Reuters  &nbspAugust 5, 2022 | 04:33 pm PT","China announced on Friday it was halting dialogue with the U.S. in a number of areas, including between theater-level military commanders and on climate change, in a furor over U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.","China announced on Friday it was halting dialogue with the U.S. in a number of areas, including between theater-level military commanders and on climate change, in a furor over U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.","China’s foreign ministry said it was also suspending exchanges with Washington on countering cross-border crime and drug trafficking, all moves Washington called ""irresponsible.""
Enraged when Pelosi became the highest-level U.S. visitor in 25 years to the self-governed island that Beijing regards as its territory, China launched military drills in the seas and skies around Taiwan on Thursday. The live-fire drills, the largest ever conducted by China in the Taiwan Strait, are scheduled to continue until noon on Sunday.
Taiwan’s defense ministry said on Friday it scrambled jets to warn away Chinese aircraft that it said entered the island’s air defense zone, some of which crossed the Taiwan Strait median line, an unofficial buffer separating the two sides.
A total of 68 Chinese military aircraft and 13 navy ships had conducted missions in the strait, the ministry said.
China’s Eastern Theater Command of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said in a statement it conducted air and sea drills to the north, southwest and east of Taiwan on Friday ""to test the troops’ joint combat capabilities"".
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington has repeatedly made clear to Beijing it does not seek a crisis over Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan, which took place on Wednesday during a congressional tour of Asia.
""There is no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response,"" he told a news conference on the sidelines of ASEAN regional meetings in Cambodia, adding, ""Now, they’ve taken dangerous acts to a new level"".
Blinken emphasized that the United States would not take actions to provoke a crisis, but it would continue to support regional allies and conduct standard air and maritime transit through the Taiwan Strait.
""We will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,"" he said.
Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi told a media briefing after the ASEAN meetings: ""I heard that U.S. Secretary of State Blinken held his news conference and spread some misinformation and was not speaking truthfully.""
""We wish to issue a warning to the United States: Do not act rashly, do not create a greater crisis,"" Wang said.
Jing Quan, a senior Chinese Embassy official in Washington, echoed that, telling a briefing: ""The only way out of this crisis is that the U.S. side must take measures immediately to rectify its mistakes and eliminate the grave impact of Pelosi’s visit.""
He said Washington should ""avoid pushing China-U.S. relations down the dangerous track of conflict and confrontation.""
Diplomatic front
White House national security spokesperson John Kirby countered that China’s move to suspend some communication channels was ""fundamentally irresponsible.""
""There’s nothing here for the United States to rectify. The Chinese can go a long way to taking the tensions down simply by stopping these provocative military exercises and ending the rhetoric,"" Kirby told reporters.
China has not mentioned a suspension of military talks at the senior-most levels, such as with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley. While those talks have been infrequent, officials have said they are important to have in the case of an emergency or accident.
Kirby said it was not atypical for China to shut down military talks at times of tension, but that ""not all channels"" between the two countries’ military leaders had been cut off.
Beijing separately announced that it would impose sanctions on Pelosi personally and her immediate family in response to her ""vicious"" and ""provocative"" actions.
Speaking at a news conference in Japan after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Pelosi said her trip to Asia was ""not about changing the status quo in Taiwan or the region.""
‘Stay calm’
Taiwan’s defense ministry said on Friday the island’s military had dispatched aircraft and ships and deployed land-based missile systems to monitor ships and aircraft that briefly crossed the Taiwan Strait median line.
On Thursday, China fired multiple missiles into waters surrounding Taiwan.
Japan’s defense ministry, which is tracking the exercises, first reported that as many as four of the missiles flew over Taiwan’s capital, which is unprecedented. It also said that five of nine missiles fired toward its territory landed in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), also a first, prompting a diplomatic protest by Tokyo.
Later, Taiwan’s defense ministry said the missiles were high in the atmosphere and constituted no threat.
Some Taipei residents, including Mayor Ko Wen-je, criticized the government for not putting out a missile alert, but one security expert said that could have been done to avoid stoking panic and playing into China’s hands.
""It counteracted the effect of the Chinese Communist Party’s psychological warfare,"" said Mei Fu-shin, a U.S.-based analyst.
Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen urged residents not to panic, saying in a Facebook post: ""Please rest assured, stay calm and live as normal.""
Bonnie Glaser, a Washington-based Asia security specialist at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said China may be rehearsing for a blockade, ""demonstrating it can block Taiwan’s ports and airports and prevent shipping.""
Taiwan has been self-ruled since 1949.
Beijing has said its relations with Taiwan are an internal matter, and that it reserves the right to bring Taiwan under Chinese control, by force if necessary.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-halts-military-climate-dialogue-with-us-over-pelosi-taiwan-trip-4496495.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-halts-military-climate-dialogue-with-us-over-pelosi-taiwan-trip-4496495.html#box_comment"")"
China sanctions Pelosi over Taiwan visit: foreign ministry,"By Reuters  &nbspAugust 5, 2022 | 01:27 am PT","China's foreign ministry announced sanctions against U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday, after her visit to Taiwan this week prompted fury and shows of military force from Beijing.","China's foreign ministry announced sanctions against U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday, after her visit to Taiwan this week prompted fury and shows of military force from Beijing.","The ministry said Pelosi was ""seriously interfering in China's internal affairs and seriously undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" with the visit, and that Beijing would ""impose sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family,"" without giving further details.
China has announced sanctions on a number of U.S. officials in recent years for acting against what it views as its core interests and speaking out on human rights issues in Hong Kong and the northwestern region of Xinjiang, often without specifying punitive measures.
In March this year Beijing said it was imposing visa restrictions on an undisclosed list of United States officials who had allegedly ""concocted lies on human rights issues involving China.""
Former U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo, as well as Peter Navarro -- a trade adviser to former president Donald Trump -- were among those hit by earlier waves of sanctions and are forbidden from entering China as well as doing business with Chinese entities.
Beijing's ruling Communist Party views self-ruled, democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to one day take it, by force if necessary.
The Chinese government has reacted with bombastic threats and military drills in the lead-up to and aftermath of Pelosi's visit, which it sees as an unacceptable escalation of ties between Washington and Taiwan's current pro-independence leaders.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-sanctions-pelosi-over-taiwan-visit-foreign-ministry-4496374.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-sanctions-pelosi-over-taiwan-visit-foreign-ministry-4496374.html#box_comment"")"
China begins major Taiwan military drills after Pelosi visit,"By AFP  &nbspAugust 3, 2022 | 10:53 pm PT","Chinese military helicopters fly past Pingtan island, one of mainland China's closest points to Taiwan, in Fujian province on Thursday.

It comes ahead of massive military drills off Taiwan following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the self-ruled island.","China's largest-ever military exercises encircling Taiwan kicked off Thursday, in a show of force straddling vital international shipping lanes after a visit to the island by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Pelosi left Taiwan Wednesday after a trip that defied a series of stark threats from Beijing, which views the self-ruled island as its territory.
It sparked a furious reaction from Beijing, which vowed ""punishment"" and announced military drills in the seas around Taiwan -- some of the world's busiest waterways.
""Six major areas around the island have been selected for this actual combat exercise and during this period, relevant ships and aircraft should not enter the relevant waters and airspaces,"" state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Taiwan's defense ministry said it was closely watching the drills.
Beijing's nationalist state-run tabloid Global Times said, citing military analysts, that the exercises were ""unprecedented"" and that missiles would fly over Taiwan for the first time.
The Group of Seven industrialized nations has condemned the drills, saying in a statement there was ""no justification to use a visit as pretext for aggressive military activity in the Taiwan Strait.""
Taiwan's Maritime and Port Bureau issued warnings on Wednesday to ships to avoid the areas being used for the Chinese drills.
Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific said it had ordered its aircraft to ""avoid going through the designated airspace zones around the Taiwan region.""
Beijing has defended the drills as ""necessary and just,"" pinning the blame for the escalation on the United States and its allies.
A Chinese military source also told AFP the exercises would be staged ""in preparation for actual combat.""
'Some limits'
The island is once again a flashpoint between the United States and a Chinese leadership keen to project strength ahead of a crucial ruling party meeting this autumn at which Xi is expected to be given an unprecedented third term.
""China's announced military exercises represent a clear escalation from the existing baseline of Chinese military activities around Taiwan and from the last Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996,"" said Amanda Hsiao, senior analyst for China at the International Crisis Group.
Nevertheless, analysts have told AFP that China is not aiming to escalate the situation beyond its control -- at least for now.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-begins-major-taiwan-military-drills-after-pelosi-visit-4495864.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-begins-major-taiwan-military-drills-after-pelosi-visit-4495864.html#box_comment"")"

ASEAN spokesman Kung Phoak, Cambodia's deputy foreign minister, said ministers at the closed-door talks - meeting face to face for the first time since the pandemic - had expressed concern over ""growing tension in the Taiwan Strait.""
""We hope that all sides will try their best to deescalate the tension there, avoid actions that may contribute to the escalation of tension and engage in dialogue,"" Kung Phoak told reporters.
Malaysia and Thailand echoed the calls for calm, with Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah urging all sides to tread ""very carefully.""
Thai foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said the kingdom called for ""utmost restraint"" and warned against ""any actions that would aggravate tensions.""
Attention will now turn to Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his American counterpart Antony Blinken who will join ASEAN and other ministers for regional security talks on Thursday and Friday.
On Wednesday, Wang slammed the trip by Pelosi - the highest-profile elected U.S. official to visit Taiwan in 25 years - as a violation of Chinese sovereignty.
""Those who play with fire will not come to a good end, and those who offend China will be punished,"" he warned in an interview in Phnom Penh with Chinese state media.

"Pelosi hails Taiwan's free society as China holds military drills, vents anger","By Reuters  &nbspAugust 2, 2022 | 08:46 pm PT","China furiously condemned the highest-level U.S. visit to Taiwan in 25 years as House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed the self-ruled island as ""one of the freest societies in the world"" in a speech to the parliament in Taipei on Wednesday.","China furiously condemned the highest-level U.S. visit to Taiwan in 25 years as House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi hailed the self-ruled island as ""one of the freest societies in the world"" in a speech to the parliament in Taipei on Wednesday.","Beijing demonstrated its anger with Pelosi's presence on an island that it says is part of China with a burst of military activity in the surrounding waters, and by summoning the U.S. ambassador in Beijing, and announcing the suspension of several agricultural imports from Taiwan.
Pelosi arrived in Taipei late on Tuesday on an unannounced but closely watched trip, saying that it shows unwavering U.S. commitment to Taiwan's democracy.
Addressing parliament on Wednesday, Pelosi praised Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen. ""We thank you for your leadership. We want the world to recognize that,"" Pelosi said, while also calling for increased inter-parliamentary cooperation.
Pelosi went on to say that new U.S. legislation aimed at strengthening the American chip industry to compete with China ""offers greater opportunity for US-Taiwan economic cooperation.""
Now more than ever, America's solidarity with Taiwan is crucial, Pelosi told Tsai, adding that America's determination to preserve democracy in Taiwan and the rest of the world remains iron-clad.
The last House Speaker to go to Taiwan was Newt Gingrich visited in 1997. But Pelosi's visit comes amid sharply deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations, and China has emerged as a far more powerful economic, military and geopolitical force during the past quarter century.
China considers Taiwan part of its territory and has never renounced using force to bring it under its control. The United States warned China against using the visit as a pretext for military action against Taiwan.
Early on Wednesday, China's customs department announced a suspension of imports of citrus fruits, chilled white striped hairtail and frozen horse mackerel from Taiwan, while its commerce ministry suspended export of natural sand to Taiwan.
Military drills
Shortly after Pelosi's arrival, China's military announced joint air and sea drills near Taiwan and test launches of conventional missiles in the sea east of Taiwan, with Chinese state news agency Xinhua describing live-fire drills and other exercises around Taiwan from Thursday to Sunday.
China's foreign ministry said Pelosi's visit seriously damages peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, ""has a severe impact on the political foundation of China-U.S. relations, and seriously infringes upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
Before Pelosi's arrival on Tuesday, Chinese warplanes buzzed the line dividing the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese military said it was on high alert and will launch ""targeted military operations"" in response to Pelosi's visit.
White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday after Pelosi's arrival that the United States ""is not going to be intimidated"" by China's threats or bellicose rhetoric and that there is no reason her visit should precipitate a crisis or conflict.
""We will continue to support Taiwan, defend a free and open Indo-Pacific and seek to maintain communication with Beijing,"" Kirby told a later White House briefing, adding that the United States ""will not engage in sabre-rattling.""
Kirby said China might engage in ""economic coercion"" toward Taiwan, adding that the impact on American-Chinese relations will depend on Beijing's actions in the coming days and weeks.
The United States has no official diplomatic relations with Taiwan but is bound by American law to provide it with the means to defend itself. China views visits by U.S. officials to Taiwan as sending an encouraging signal to the pro-independence camp on the island.
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a news conference that the government has conveyed concerns over the military operations to China, and reiterated that Japan hopes issues over the Taiwan Strait will be resolved through dialogue.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/pelosi-hails-taiwan-s-free-society-as-china-holds-military-drills-vents-anger-4495395.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/pelosi-hails-taiwan-s-free-society-as-china-holds-military-drills-vents-anger-4495395.html#box_comment"")"

""The move is extremely egregious in nature and the consequences are extremely serious,"" Mr Xie was quoted as saying by China's state news agency Xinhua. ""China will not sit idly by.""
The trip by Mrs Pelosi, the highest-profile elected US official to visit Taiwan in 25 years, sent tensions soaring between the world's two largest economies, with Beijing regarding it as a major provocation.
Mr Xie said the United States ""shall pay the price for its own mistakes"" and urged Washington to ""immediately address its wrongdoings, take practical measures to undo the adverse effects caused by Pelosi's visit to Taiwan"", Xinhua reported.
Mrs Pelosi landed in Taiwan late Tuesday, defying a string of angry warnings from Beijing. While the Biden administration is understood to be opposed to Mrs Pelosi's Taiwan stop, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said in Washington she was entitled to go where she pleased.
China's military said it was on ""high alert"" and would ""launch a series of targeted military actions in response"" to the visit. It announced plans for a series of military exercises in waters around the island to begin on Wednesday.
And Taiwan's defence ministry said more than 21 Chinese military aircraft had flown on Tuesday into the island's air defence identification zone - an area wider than its territorial airspace that overlaps with part of China's own air defence zone.
Taiwan’s defence ministry said on Wednesday that Chinese live-fire drills around the democratic island this week demonstrated Beijing’s intention to destroy regional peace and stability.
Taiwan has enhanced alertness levels and will react timely and appropriately to the drills, a defence ministry spokesman told reporters via a voice message.
""Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and Taiwan will eventually return to the embrace of the motherland. Chinese people are not afraid of ghosts, pressure and the evil,"" Mr Xie told Mr Burns, according to Xinhua.

The Japanese-based Reagan is operating with a guided missile cruiser, USS Antietam, and a destroyer, USS Higgins.
""While they are able to respond to any eventuality, these are normal, routine deployments,"" the official said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that they were unable to comment on precise locations.
The U.S. Navy official said the amphibious assault ship USS Tripoli was also in the area as part of a deployment to the region that started in early May from its home port of San Diego.
Pelosi, a long-time China critic, was expected to arrive in Taipei later on Tuesday, people briefed on the matter said, as the United States said it would not be intimidated by Chinese ""saber rattling"" over the visit.
Confirmation of the deployments comes as signs emerge of military activity on both sides of the Taiwan strait ahead of Pelosi visit.
In addition to Chinese planes flying close to the median line dividing the sensitive waterway on Tuesday morning, several Chinese warships had remained close to the unofficial dividing line since Monday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters.
China's defense and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The source said both Chinese warships and aircraft ""squeezed"" the median line on Tuesday morning, an unusual move the person described as ""very provocative.""
The person said the Chinese aircraft repeatedly conducted tactical moves of briefly ""touching"" the median line and circling back to the other side of the strait on Tuesday morning, while Taiwanese aircraft were on standby nearby.
Neither side's aircraft normally cross the median line.
Taiwan's Defense Ministry said on Tuesday they have a full grasp of military activities near Taiwan and will appropriately dispatch forces in reaction to ""enemy threats"" as tensions rise with China.
The ministry had ""reinforced"" its combat alertness level from Tuesday morning to Thursday noon, the island's official Central News Agency reported on Tuesday, citing unidentified sources.
In the southeastern Chinese city of Xiamen, which lies opposite Taiwan and is home to a large military presence, residents reported sightings of armored vehicles on the move and posted pictures online. The photographs have yet to be verified by Reuters.
Chinese social media was abuzz with both trepidation about potential conflict and patriotic fervor over the prospect of unification with Taiwan.
Since last week, the People's Liberation Army has conducted various exercises, including live fire drills, in the South China, Yellow Sea and Bohan Seas.
Some regional military analysts say that increased deployments at a time of tension raise the risk of accidents, even if no side wants an actual conflict.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/us-navy-deploys-four-warships-east-of-taiwan-as-pelosi-heads-to-taipei-4495028.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/us-navy-deploys-four-warships-east-of-taiwan-as-pelosi-heads-to-taipei-4495028.html#box_comment"")"

He noted that members of Congress have routinely visited Taiwan over the years.
Kirby said administration officials are concerned that Beijing could use the visit as an excuse to take provocative retaliatory steps, including military action such as firing missiles in the Taiwan Strait or around Taiwan, flying sorties into Taiwan’s airspace and carrying out large-scale naval exercises in the strait.
""Put simply, there is no reason for Beijing to turn a potential visit consistent with long-standing US policy into some sort of crisis or use it as a pretext to increase aggressive military activity in or around the Taiwan Strait,"" Kirby said.
The Biden administration pushed back on Beijing as Pelosi held talks with officials in Singapore on Monday at the start of her Asian tour.
While there have been no official announcements, local media in Taiwan reported that Pelosi will arrive Tuesday night, making her the highest-ranking elected US official to visit in more than 25 years. The United Daily News, Liberty Times and China Times — Taiwan’s three largest national newspapers — cited unidentified sources as saying she would arrive in Taipei after visiting Malaysia and spend the night.
Talk of such a visit is sparking fury in Beijing, which regards Taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly warned of ""serious consequences"" if the reported trip goes ahead.
""If Pelosi insists on visiting Taiwan, China will take resolute and strong measures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said in Beijing, without giving details.
""Those who play with fire will perish by it,"" Zhao said. ""We would like to once again admonish the US that we are fully prepared for any eventuality and the (People’s Liberation Army) will never sit idly by.""
China’s ambassador to the United Nations Zhang Hun labelled the potential visit ""very much dangerous, very much provocative"" as he spoke to reporters Monday.
""If the US insists on making the visit, China will take firm and strong measures to safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he said at a briefing.
Chinese President Xi Jinping also warned the US against meddling in Beijing’s dealings with the island in a a phone call last week with President Joe Biden.
Diplomatic, military escalation
China has been steadily ratcheting up diplomatic and military pressure on Taiwan. Threats of retaliation for a visit by Pelosi have driven concerns of a new crisis in the Taiwan Strait, which separates the two sides, that could roil global markets and supply chains.
Beijing sees official American contact with Taiwan as encouragement to make the island’s decades-old de facto independence permanent, a step US leaders say they don’t support. Pelosi, head of one of three branches of the US government, would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit Taiwan since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.
""What I can say is this: this is very much precedent in the sense that previous speakers have visited Taiwan, many members of Congress go to Taiwan, including this year,"" Secretary of State Antony Bliken said. ""And so, if the speaker does decide to visit and China tries to create some kind of crisis or otherwise escalate tensions, that would be entirely on Beijing.""
Kirby stressed that US policy was unchanged toward Taiwan. This means support for its self-ruling government, recognizing Chinese sovereignty, and opposing either a full independence bid by Taiwan or a forceful takeover by China.
""Nothing has changed,"" he said. ""There’s certainly no reason for this to come to blows.""
Still, US officials have signalled that the military would be prepared to respond if needed in the event of any action by China in response to any possible stop in Taiwan by Pelosi.
On Monday, the Navy aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan and its strike group were in the Philippine Sea, according to the officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations.
The Reagan, the USS Antietam, a cruiser, and the USS Higgins, a destroyer, left Singapore after a port visit and moved north, heading to their homeport in Japan. The carrier has an array of aircraft, including F/A-18 fighter jets and helicopters, on board as well as sophisticated radar systems and other weapons.
First stop in Singapore
On Monday, Pelosi met with Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, President Halimah Yacob and other Cabinet members.
Singapore's Foreign Ministry said Lee welcomed a U.S. commitment to strong engagement with the region, and the two sides discussed ways to deepen U.S. economic involvement through initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.
Lee and Pelosi also discussed the war in Ukraine, tensions surrounding Taiwan and mainland China, and climate change, it said in a statement. Lee ""highlighted the importance of stable US-China relations for regional peace and security,"" it added, in an apparent allusion to reports of Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan.
Pelosi has said she is visiting Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan in a tour to discuss trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, security and ""democratic governance.""
On Thursday, Pelosi is to meet with South Korean National Assembly Speaker Kim Jin Pyo in Seoul for talks on security in the Indo-Pacific region, economic cooperation and the climate crisis, Kim’s office said in a statement.
It declined to provide further details about her itinerary, including when she is arriving in South Korea and how long she’ll stay. Pelosi’s schedule for Wednesday remains unclear and there were no details on when she will head to Japan.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/white-house-warns-china-against-escalation-over-pelosi-s-potential-taiwan-visit-4494796.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/white-house-warns-china-against-escalation-over-pelosi-s-potential-taiwan-visit-4494796.html#box_comment"")"
China heightens warning to US over possible House Speaker Pelosi visit to Taiwan,"By Reuters  &nbspJuly 23, 2022 | 07:14 pm PT","China has issued stark private warnings to the Biden administration about a possible trip to Taiwan in August by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.","China has issued stark private warnings to the Biden administration about a possible trip to Taiwan in August by U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.","The report cited six people familiar with the Chinese warnings as saying they were significantly stronger than the threats that Beijing has made in the past when it was unhappy with U.S. actions or policy on Taiwan, which is claimed by China.
The private rhetoric suggested a possible military response, the Financial Times cited several people familiar with the situation as saying.
The White House National Security Council and the State Department declined to comment on the report.
China has been stepping up military activity around Taiwan seeking to pressure the democratically-elected government there to accept Chinese sovereignty.
Taiwan's government says only the island's 23 million people can decide their future, and while it wants peace will defend itself if attacked.
On July 18, the Financial Times reported that Pelosi plans to visit Taiwan in August.
A day later, China's foreign ministry said that a visit to Taiwan by Pelosi would seriously undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the United States would bear the consequences of its response.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-heightens-warning-to-us-over-possible-house-speaker-pelosi-visit-to-taiwan-4491440.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-heightens-warning-to-us-over-possible-house-speaker-pelosi-visit-to-taiwan-4491440.html#box_comment"")"
"Biden plans talks with China's Xi soon, casts doubt on Pelosi Taiwan trip","By Reuters  &nbspJuly 20, 2022 | 05:56 pm PT","U.S. President Joe Biden plans to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, by the end of the month at a moment of simmering tensions between the countries over Taiwan and trade.","U.S. President Joe Biden plans to speak with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, by the end of the month at a moment of simmering tensions between the countries over Taiwan and trade.","""I think I'll be talking to President Xi within the next 10 days,"" Biden told reporters as he returned from a climate-related trip to Massachusetts.
The long-discussed call between the two leaders, their first in four months, would come at a crucial moment given tensions over the status of Taiwan, and as the Biden administration weighs cutting import duties on goods from China to help reduce inflation pressures on American consumers.
The United States calls China its main strategic rival and says high-level engagement is important to keeping the difficult relationship stable and preventing it from veering inadvertently into conflict. Last month, Washington pushed NATO to adopt a strategic document calling China a security challenge.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Biden appeared to cast doubt on a trip reportedly planned by House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan next month.
""I think that the military thinks it's not a good idea right now, but I don't know what the status of it is,"" Biden said.
Beijing said on Tuesday that it would respond with ""forceful measures"" should Pelosi visit the Chinese-claimed island, and that such a visit would ""seriously undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
Pelosi's office declined to comment on whether the visit is moving forward, citing security concerns. The State Department has called the trip ""hypothetical."" Plans for the trip were reported by the Financial Times , which also said the White House had expressed concerns.
China considers the democratically-governed island its own territory, and the issue is a constant irritant in ties between Beijing and Washington.
Biden's administration has repeatedly spoken of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the island's security.
U.S. military vessels were conducting transits through the Taiwan Strait as recently as Tuesday, angering Beijing, which sent fighters across the strait's median line this month following a visit to Taipei by U.S. Senator Rick Scott.
On trade, the Biden administration has been at odds with China over fulfilling its commitments to existing agreements.
But rising inflation has prompted a look at possible tariff relief, including on the 'Section 301' tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump, covering some $370 billion in Chinese imports.
People familiar with the tariff deliberations have told Reuters that Biden also is weighing whether to pair a removal of some tariffs with a new investigation into China's industrial subsidies and efforts to dominate key sectors, such as semiconductors. Such a probe could lead to more tariffs.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/biden-plans-talks-with-china-s-xi-soon-casts-doubt-on-pelosi-taiwan-trip-4490284.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/biden-plans-talks-with-china-s-xi-soon-casts-doubt-on-pelosi-taiwan-trip-4490284.html#box_comment"")"
China warns of 'forceful measures' if US House Speaker Pelosi visits Taiwan,"By Reuters  &nbspJuly 19, 2022 | 01:41 am PT","China's government warned on Tuesday it would take ""forceful measures"" if U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, after the Financial Times said she would go to the Chinese-claimed island next month.","China's government warned on Tuesday it would take ""forceful measures"" if U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, after the Financial Times said she would go to the Chinese-claimed island next month.","Pelosi and her delegation will also visit Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, and spend time in Hawaii at the headquarters of U.S. Indo-Pacific command, the paper added, citing people familiar with the matter.
Her office and the U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said it has ""not received relevant information"" about any visit.
The Democratic leader's visit to Taiwan had been postponed from April, after she tested positive for COVID-19. At the time, China said such a visit would severely affect Chinese-U.S. relations.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said any visit by Pelosi would ""seriously undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity"".
""If the U.S. side obstinately clings to this course, China will definitely take resolute and forceful measures to firmly defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he said.
""The United States must be fully responsible for all the consequences caused by this.""
Taiwan faces mounting pressure from China, which considers the democratically ruled island its own territory. The issue is a constant irritant in ties between Beijing and Washington.
Taiwan, however, has been heartened by continued support offered by the Biden administration, which has repeatedly talked of its ""rock-solid"" commitment to the island.
The White House had expressed concern about the trip, the Financial Times said, citing three people familiar with the situation.
There were divisions in the U.S. administration over whether Pelosi should visit Taiwan, the paper quoted two sources as saying.
China sent fighters across the Taiwan Strait's median line this month in what the latter described as a provocation. The incident came during a visit to Taipei by U.S. Senator Rick Scott, a senior Republican and member of the Senate's Armed Services Committee.
News of Pelosi's August visit comes after China asked the United States on Monday to immediately cancel a potential sale of military technical assistance to Taiwan worth an estimated $108 million.","=HYPERLINK(""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-warns-of-forceful-measures-if-us-house-speaker-pelosi-visits-taiwan-4489652.html#box_comment"", ""https://e.vnexpress.net/news/world/china-warns-of-forceful-measures-if-us-house-speaker-pelosi-visits-taiwan-4489652.html#box_comment"")"
